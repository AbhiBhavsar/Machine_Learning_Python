# Machine_Learning_Python
Contains notebooks for ML with python Scikit Learn and PyTorch frameworks.

## About Scikit learn projects:
These project are developed on local setup with jupyter notebook and requiers
the machine installation of python.

I've used `conda` for python and all other package management. We can use the
`environments.yml` with conda to init the project with all dependencies.

## About PyTorch projects:
This contains the pytorch workflow, Transfer Learning, and End-to-End ML model
deployment code using HuggingFace's Gradio demo to host the app.
